# Decision
## Abstract
This is a simple practice of combining weak learners, decision stump, which is also known as **Decision Tree**.
## Usage
1. `DecisionTree.py` is the source code of our Decision Tree algorithm includeing the base learner, decision stump.
2. `model_test.py` is to see whether our DecisionTree algorithm works well, using the data files: test.dat.txt, train.dat.txt.
